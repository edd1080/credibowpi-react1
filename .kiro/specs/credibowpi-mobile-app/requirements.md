# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CrediBowpi is an offline-first mobile application designed exclusively for field credit agents, enabling them to capture, manage, and evaluate credit applications in a 100% digital and operational manner even without internet connection. The app replaces manual paper-based processes with a modern, reliable, secure, and fast end-to-end workflow.

The application's key differentiator is allowing any field agent, without technical training, to perform pre-qualifications, complete complex modular forms, capture documents and photographs, sign contracts on screen, and submit applications that will be automatically evaluated later.

5. WHEN I tap the sync indicator THEN the system SHALL provide options to manually trigger synchronization

### Requirement 3

6. WHEN KYC is complete THEN the system SHALL allow progression to the full application form

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a field credit agent, I want to complete complex application forms through modular sections, so that I can systematically gather all required client information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application form THEN the system SHALL present it divided into logical sections: identification, finances, business, guarantees, attachments, and review
2. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL use a persistent picker interface for easy section switching
3. WHEN I fill form fields THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation with visual feedback
4. WHEN conditional logic applies THEN the system SHALL show/hide relevant fields dynamically

2. WHEN the client signs THEN the system SHALL capture the signature with smooth drawing capabilities
3. WHEN the signature is unsatisfactory THEN the system SHALL provide a "Clear" button to restart
4. WHEN the signature is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a "Save Signature" button
5. WHEN the signature is saved THEN the system SHALL store it securely as part of the application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a field credit agent, I want all application data to be saved locally and work offline, so that I can continue working regardless of internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make any significant change THEN the system SHALL save data locally in real-time using encrypted SQLite
2. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL continue to function with full form capabilities
3. WHEN I complete an application offline THEN the system SHALL queue it for synchronization
4. WHEN internet becomes available THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt synchronization every 5 minutes
